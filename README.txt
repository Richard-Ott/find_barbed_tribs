This is a small set of TopoToolbox (Schwanghart & Scherler 2014) functions that
maps the location of barbed tributaries. To do so, the code uses a modified
networksegment.m function (networksegment_barbed) and compares angles of
stream segment flow directions at the confluence.
An example script on how to use the functions is provided (mapping_barbed_tribs.m)
